==== Risks table

1.	Select the primary asset. In this case, `Department`.
2.	Click on tab `Operational risks`.
3.	Total of operational risks associated to primary asset.
4.	Ability to select only certain risks, according to the risk acceptance threshold.
5.	Ability to sort on most columns of the table.
6.	Selection of the page in the list of results.

NOTE: The operational risk table may or may not display the inherent risks. They are the operational risks that would impact the organization without any controls in place.
To show this option see <<Creating a Risk Analysis>>.

1.	`Asset`: Assets involved in the evaluation
2.	`Risk description`: Description of risk
3.	`Inherent risk`: Operational risk is calculated from the two factors, the probability (`Prob.`) of the risk scenario and the `Impact` based on the ROLFPfootnoteref:[rolfp] without controls in place. The current risk represents the maximum value of the probability on the ROLFP impact values.
4.	`Net risk`: Net risk represents the risk with the measures currently in place. The calculation is the same as for the inherent risks.
5.	`Existing controls`: Describe here, in a factual manner, the control in place.
6.	`Treatment`: Indication if the risk is treated and risk profile (see <<Operational risk sheet>>).
7.	`Residual risk` : Value of the residual risk. In the case of the figure above, the residual risk is equal to the max risk because it has been not yet treated.

====	Operational risk sheet

The risk card is displayed when you click on the `Not treated` link in the operational risk table.

1.	`Back to the list`: Return to risk table.
2.	`Current risk`: Values for risk probability (`Prob.`) and ROLFPfootnoteref:[rolfp] Criteria.
3.	`Residual risk` : Values for risk probability and ROLFPfootnoteref:[rolfp] criteria (not yet treated). Those values should be adjusted according to the recommendation and the measures that will be put in place.
4.	Reminder of the parameters of the risk table.
5.	`Recommmendations` : Creation / Assignment button for adding one or more recommendations.
6.	`Kind of treatment` : Selection of the type of risk treatment, the 4 values have their sources of ISO / IEC 27005 :

  a.	Modification / Reduce
  b.	Refused
  c.	Accepted
  d.	Shared

NOTE: Once the validation has been done, the risk is treated.

==== Adding additional risk

When an asset is selected in the analysis:

1.	Click to `create a specific risk`: A pop-up appears and allows a new risk to be associated with the current asset. If the risk does not exist, it can be created directly.
