1.	The creation of a risk analysis is always based on an existing model. There are two choices for this:
a.	`CASES Model`: Proposes available models in the knowledge bases. This option has at least two choices, `Modelling CASES`,
this is the default template made available by the MONARC editor. It provides sufficient knowledge bases to start a risk analysis.
This option should be used by default to start a new risk analysis. There is also the choice `Blank model` which is a completely empty model.
This template is typically used temporarily as a _Sandbox_ to test the contents of an import file, for example.
b.	`Existing analysis`: Duplicate a risk analysis of your choice present in your environment.
2.	Options *_a_* or *_b_* before selected. It get the source.
3.  `Show inherent operational risks`. (see <<Operational Risks>>)
