By selecting the top of the analysis or an asset in the tree, the risk table appears. There are two separate risk tables:

image:RiskTable.png[Risk Tables]

1.	The information risk table based on CIAfootnoteref:[CIA,Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.] criteria.
2.	The operational risk table based on ROLFPfootnoteref:[rolfp,Reputation, Operational, Legal, Financial and Personal] (see <<Operational Risks>>)

Depending selection, the display risk table may change:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Selection|Information Risks|Operational Risks
|Root of analysis | All risks of analysis | All risks of analysis
|Primary Asset | Risks associated with his supporting assets | Risks associated with himself
|Supporting Asset| Risks associated with himself| No risks
|=======================

==== Risks table

image:InfoRiskTable.png[Information Risk Table]

1.	The primary asset `Department` is selected in the analysis.
2.	Display the CIA impacts of the `Department`.
3.	Information Risk tab selected.
4.	`Department` asset consists of supporting assets that provide total information risks.
5.	Possibility to select only certain risks according to the risk acceptance threshold.
6.	Ability to sort of most columns of the table.
7.	Selection of the page in the list of results.

image:FieldsInfoRiskTable.png[Fields of Information Risk Table]

1.	`Asset`: Assets involved in the evaluation.
2.	`CIA Impact`: The CIA criteria that have been assigned to the `Department` are inherited by default from the supporting assets.
3.	`Prob`: Likelihood of threat (see <<Likelihood scale>>).
4.	`Existing controls`: Describe, in a factual manner, the security control in place concerning the vulnerability or, more broadly, the risk.
5.	`Qualif`: Evaluation of control in place in order to determine the level of vulnerability (see <<Vulnerability scale>>).
6.	`Current risk`: Risk value calculated according to the risk calculation formula. The colours depend on the risk acceptance grid (see <<Acceptance thresholds>>).
7.	`Treatment`: Indication if the risk is treated, and links to the risk profile (see <<Risk information sheet>>).
8.	`Residual risk`: Value of residual risk. In the case of the figure above, the residual risk is equal to the max risk because it is not yet treated.

NOTE: By leaving the cursor in most fields, a tooltip appears.

====	Risk information sheet

The risk sheet is displayed when you click on the `Not treated` link in the information risk table.

image:InfoRiskSheet.png[Information Risk Sheet]

1.	Click to turn back to risk table.
2.	Risk values for CID criteria (not yet covered in the example).
3.	Reminders of the parameters of the risk table.
4.	Creation / Assignment button for one or more recommendations.
5.	Selection of the kind of treatment:

  a.	Reduction / Modification
  b.	Denied
  c.	Accepted
  d.	Shared

6.	Choosing a risk reduction value, the more effective the control is, the greater the reduction value is.
7.	Proposals of controls, which come from various repositories.

WARNING: Do not forget to save the form in order to calculate the residual risk.

====	Adding additional risk

When an asset is selected in the analysis:

image:SpecificRisk.png[Specific Risk]

1. Click to `create a specific risk`: A pop-up appears and allows to associate a threat and vulnerability pair with the current asset.

NOTE: Threat and vulnerability must exist beforehand.


==== Contextual menu of asset

By clicking on the icon image:Menu.png[pdfwidth=4%,width=4%], the context menu of asset appears:

image:ContextualMenuAsset.png[Contextual Menu of Asset]

1.	`Edit impacts`: Displays the impact and consequence modification view (see <<Impacts and consequences>>).
2.	`Import analysis`: Allows you to import an analysis from the location pointed to by the selected asset of the scan. The import works exactly like importing an asset. (See <<Importing an asset>>.)
3.  `Export analysis`: Allows you to export analysis, from the place pointed by the selected asset of the analysis. The export works exactly like exporting an asset. (See <<Exporting an asset>>.)
+
NOTE: The additional option, `export with assessment`. It means, export gets the evaluation and treatment of risks. By default is disabled.

+

4.  `See asset in the library`: Displays the asset from the library, allowing you to have another context menu that allows changes to the asset. (See <<Context menu of library>>.)
5.	`Detach` : This removes an asset from the risk analysis.
+

WARNING: This action may lead to the loss of risk assessments for this asset and its childrens.



====	Impacts and consequences

The aim is to define the level of the primary assets, the impacts and consequences that can result from the realization of the risks of the model.

The pop-up below appears.

image:Impacts.png[Impacts]

1.  Consultation of impact scales is done through the menu at the top right of the screen.
+

NOTE: By leaving the pointer unmoved over the numbers,the meaning of this number appears after one second.

When one of the criteria *C* (confidentiality), *I* (integrity) or *A* (availability) is allocated, there is a need to ask : what are the
consequences on the company, and more particularly on its ROLFP, i.e. its **R**eputation, its **O**peration, its **L**egal, its **F**inances
or the impact on the **P**erson (in the sense of personal data).

In the case of the above figure, the `3` (out of 5) impact on confidentiality, is explained by the maximum value ROLFP regarding
confidentiality. For example, `3` is the consequence of the person in case of disclosure of his personal file.

NOTE: To hide the consequences that will not consider. Click on the icon image:Hide.png[pdfwidth=4%,width=3%]. To show it again. Click on `Show hidden consequences`
