[start=2]
.	Calling the Management view of `Evaluation scales`

image:ContextMenuEvaluationScale2.png[ContextMenuEvaluationScale]

The view `Evaluation scales` shows the following criterias:

*	Impact scale
*	Likelihood scale
*	Vulnerability scale
*	The management of information risk acceptance thresholds
*	The management of operational risk acceptance thresholds

NOTE: All scales are editable and customizable.

WARNING: However, it is no longer permitted to modify scales as soon as an evaluation has been encoded.

=== Impact scale

=== Vulnerability scale

1.	Click to modify the number of scales
2.	Click to edit the heading on each scale (Management identical to the impact scale).


=== Acceptance thresholds
There are two separate tables for acceptability thresholds, as operational risk and information risk are not calculated in the same way.
Information risks are calculated using three criteria:

1. Modification of thresholds levels of informations risks. The table displayed above (as well as the risk analysis tables) is updated automatically.
2. Information risks are calculated using three criteria: `Impact x Threat x Vulnerability`
3. Modification of thresholds levels of operational risks. The table displayed above (as well as the risk analysis tables) is updated automatically.
4. Operational riks are calculated using two criteria: `Impact x Probability`
