 The menu is always accessible from the main view of MONARC:

1.	Calling the menu
2.	Calling the Management view of evaluation scales

The following pop-up appears:

1.	Creating a Snapshot: Possibility to enter a comment allowing to contextualize the Snapshot.
2.	Possible actions:

  a.	View a Snapshot
  b.	Restore Snapshot. Caution this option will overwrite the current analysis.
  c.	Delete a Snapshot.

When viewing a Snapshot, no changes are possible, and the blue bar as shown above is displayed:

1.	Click on the button to return to normal operation.
