. *Overview*

Global dashboard manipulates with the data stored on the Stats Service side.
The statistics of all the existed analyzes of the instance is collected on daily base and send to the Stats Service, where it is saved in the database.
If an analyse is removed, its related statistics data is also removed from the Stats Service database.
You can find details of the Stats Service installation in our link:https://www.monarc.lu/documentation/technical-guide/#stats-service[*Technical Guide*],

Stats Service can send anonymised statistics data (no client information to identify a client or instance) to a central data storage link:https://dashboard.monarc.lu[*Global statistics*].
The services architecture is available link:https://monarc-stats-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html[*here*].
By default the statistics is shared and aims to help the community of Monarc in the future link:https://github.com/monarc-project/MonarcAppFO/wiki/Roadmap#community[*weather forecast*].
The statistics sharing can be disabled (see point 5 - Global Dashboard statistics sharing option).
